# Code-Quiz

In this Repository I work to execute a Coding Quiz. This will be an interactive quiz of 5 questions with a timer counting down. An incorrect answer will lead to a deduction in time.  T

There are four pages The Homepage, High Score Page, Quiz Page and Submission Page. The Homepage have the High Score in the top left corner and the timer on the right in the header. 

A button in the center of teh page leading to the quiz. Clicking the button will start the exam and the timer as well. There will be five multiple choice questions and with option as an answer for each clicking the wrong answer will result in a reduction of time. At the end of the quiz your score will be the time remaining the higher the better. 

You will also be  able to see your score at the end of the quiz, a submission page will appear to enter your name. which will store you're high score for you to view later.
